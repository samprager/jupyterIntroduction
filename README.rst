JupyterLab Introduction
=======================

This project provides guides for installing and setting up JupyterLab notebooks and extensions and for using JupyterLab and Sphinx to create documentation.

All documentation was generated from JupyterLab_ notebooks using nbsphinx_.

Example Jupyter notebooks are provided for python, octave/Matlab and SOS. The Jupyter notebooks can be run interactively by following the installation instructions, cloning the source repository, and opening JupyterLab:

If JupyterLab is already installed:
    #. ``git clone https://github.com/samprager/jupyterIntroduction.git``

    #. ``cd jupyterIntroduction``.

    #. ``jupyter lab``

These notebooks can also be run interactively in binder!
